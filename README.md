# introduction
In this project we have proposed the EEDepth, which is an enhanced-edge underwater depth estimation network.EEDepth infers underwater depth by focusing on structural and texture information. The model's performance was benchmarked on two real underwater datasets, surpassing the current state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its accuracy and generalization ability.
